# Todo List
-----------

This program was created using Justin Herrick's <a href ="https://github.com/jah2488/todo-csv">todo list program</a> as a starting point.

The model skeleton was used as the <a href="https://github.com/tiy-austin-ror-may2015/model-skeleton">template file</a> layout also taken from Justin Herrick.
